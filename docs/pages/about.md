# **About Me**

##### Hey there, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave: I'm a passionate backend and game systems developer, and I'm always looking to learn more and get better with the technologies I use. I use my experience both to produce better systems and code, and to help my peers further their understanding as well.

<!-- Like many others in the games industry, games were a huge part of my life growing up, especially puzzle and adventure games where you need to learn the game inside and out to succeed.  -->

##### My passion lies in the game dev space, though less so in creating games themselves. I prefer bringing to life the tools and technologies behind them. When making a game, you need to have a solid set of tools to support development, and that's where I come in. I find the engineering of underlying data systems and APIs fascinating, and love the challenge of carving my own path towards a solution with no definite answer that fits the needs of the system. I consider code readability paramount, as it promotes understanding and leads to more robust solutions.
